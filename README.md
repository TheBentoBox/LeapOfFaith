# LeapOfFaith
A unique runner created entirely in JavaScript.

Players control three characters which they can switch between freely, each with three abilities they can use to try to defeat the current enemy while surviving as long as possible. Using the ability keys (Q-W-E) uses the three different abilities of whoever is at the front of the party. Players also control the jumping of the party leader, but the other party members jump automatically based on when the leader jumps. All three characters have completely differing ability sets. Upon completion of a level (which get progressively longer and faster), the player can spend some of their experience points to upgrade their abilities.

Leap of Faith was developed as a class project, taken from concept to its current state over the course of about 6 weeks combined.
